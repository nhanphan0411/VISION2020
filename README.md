# ESRGANS

The Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN) is a seminal work that is capable of upscaling low-resolution images to high-resolution ones while generating realistic textures. The whole project is built on Tensorflow2. Its model is designed based on Xintao Wang et alâ€™s research on ESRGAN (2018) - inherits the idea about Residual-in-Residual Dense Block. 

At the end, the project successfully generates high-resolution photo that sizes up to 8 times (per dimension) compared with the low-resolution one.

Please refer to below code to download the dataset. 

## PREPARE DATASET
To prepare dataset for training, move to ```/src``` and run:

```
python3 data.py --download --dataset ['div2k' or 'f2k']
```

The dataset will be downloaded to ```data``` folder, which locates at the project's root folder.

## TRAIN

Training process for the GAN system includes two phases Initial Generator Training and GAN Training. To start the training session, run: 

```
python3 train.py 
--type ['generator' or 'gan'] 
--dataset div2k 
--epochs [number of training epochs]
--genpath [generator's weight path - optional]
--dispath [discriminator's weight path - optional]
--logname [name of loss record log file] 
--modelname [name of saved model]
```

Saved model directory is set at '../log/model' at default.

## DEMO WEB APP

To run demo app, back to project root's folder and run:

```
python3 app/main.py
```
